# 7P1A Final Project

This project will use python and pygame to create an immersive gaming experience and engage users who have attention span issues. The game itself will be a board game with mini games in which players are trying to score the most points within a limited amount of turns.  Potentially useful in waiting rooms for pediatric care to calm children before appointments and allow them to interact with other children to alleviate stress and boredom before appointments and procedures.
